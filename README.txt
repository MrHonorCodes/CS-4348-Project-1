# Java CPU and Memory Simulator

## Description

This project simulates a basic CPU and Memory architecture using Java. The CPU class handles the logic for the instruction set, and the Memory class handles storing and retrieving data. Both classes communicate via processes.

## Files

1. CPU.java - This file contains the CPU simulator, with functionality for executing a set of instructions.
2. Memory.java - This file simulates the memory, handling read and write operations.
3. sample_1-4.txt - These files are the given sample files that are used to validate the program.
4. sample_5.txt - This file is the sample file that I created which should output a bunny as shown here:
(\___/)
(=^.^=)
(")_(")

5. Summary.docx - This file provides a summary of the project and personal insight. 
6. README.txt - This file provides an overview of the project and helps run the program.

## How to Compile
